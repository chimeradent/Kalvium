This is the Indian General Election Analysis for Kalvium's data analyst role. 

I have used sentiment analysis, to gauge the public's sentiment of the political climate in India. 

Furthermore, I have used Power Bi to represent the data that has been garnered throughout the elections. The datasets that have been used are kaggle datasets, which have been attached to the github repository.
